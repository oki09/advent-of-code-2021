# AoC 2021

For the very first time, I decided to participate in the this years Advent of Code challenge. I will try my luck with Kotlin, since its a language, which I wanted to learn someday.

## Day 1
Pretty easy to solve (Yeah, I know its only day 1 ðŸ˜…), but as a AoC virgin I am pretty satisfied with my solution (and Kotlin ðŸ˜„)

Many days to come...
